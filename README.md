# fix-my-joystick

Remap joystick axes to work around some games which use the wrong ones.

This project is abandoned at the moment since I no longer need it.

You'll almost certainly be better served by one of the following projects by other people:
* evemu, for debugging USB HID devices
* evmapd, for remapping things on those devices
* xboxdrv, for anything that can be made to look like an XBox controller
